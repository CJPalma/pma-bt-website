				Because advancing music in America is a priority of Phi Mu Alpha, our chapter hosts a music competition at the University Center Patio on the University of Miami campus. This event raises funds to support music education in America, and advancing music throughout the Miami area.
			</p>

			<p>
				The idea for this event developed from our past event called “ElectroPhi,” an electronic music competition we hosted in 2013. Last semester’s Battle of the Bands was a huge success, and incorporated many genres of music into the competition, since we opened up auditions to all artists and bands. In addition to a large scope of music, we want to involve the entire Coral Gables community by allowing <strong>any artist or band in Coral Gables to audition</strong>.
