				Because advancing music in America is a priority of Phi Mu Alpha, our chapter will be hosting a music competition at the University Center Patio on the University of Miami campus. This event will raise funds to support music education in America, and advancing music throughout the Miami area.
			</p>
			<p>
				The idea for this event developed from our past event called “ElectroPhi,” an electronic music competition we hosted in 2013. Last semester’s Battle of the Bands was a huge success, and incorporated many genres of music into the competition, since we opened up auditions to all artists and bands. In addition to a large scope of music, we want to involve the entire Coral Gables community by allowing ANY ARTIST OR BAND IN CORAL GABLES to audition.
