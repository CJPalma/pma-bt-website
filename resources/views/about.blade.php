	<h1 class="title">Beta Tau Chapter</h1>
	<p>
		Founded on March 5, 1937, the Beta Tau chapter is one of the oldest collegiate chapters of Phi Mu Alpha that is still active. As the first menâ€™s fraternal organization at the University of Miami, it helped establish many of the on campus traditions, including the O-Cheer competition, and dedicated the Alma Mater Plaque in the UC breezeway.

		While many members originate from the the music school, the chapter has brothers from many different majors at the University including Engineering, Marine Science, Biology, Chemistry, International Business, and filmmaking.

	<h1 class="title">National Organization</h1>
	<p>
		Phi Mu Alpha began at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, referred to originally as the Sinfonia Club. On October 6, 1898, now known as Founder's Day, a meeting was held to discuss the setup of an intercollegiate network of chapters. Two years later, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia officially became a national fraternity with the initation of the Beta Chapter at the Broad Street Conservatory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
	</p>
	<p>
		While Phi Mu Alpha is now a social fraternity, this was not always the case. The professional period of Phi Mu Alpha began at the end of World War II, when men returning from war were less focused on musical ideals and were instead seeking employment. The fraternity offered men training to improve their success as musicians, oftentimes specifically striving to improve their skills as music educators. As the years passed, members began to focus again on the ideals of brotherhood set forth by Ossian Mills and the other founding members.
