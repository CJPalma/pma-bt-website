			<h3>Battle of the Bands Competition</h3>

			<h4>About</h4>
            <p>Because advancing music in America is a priority of Phi Mu Alpha, our chapter will be hosting a music competition at the University Center Patio on the University of Miami campus. This event will raise funds to support music education in America, and advancing music throughout the Miami area. </p>
            <p>The idea for this event developed from our past event called “ElectroPhi,” an electronic music competition we hosted in 2013. Last semester’s Battle of the Bands was a huge success, and incorporated many genres of music into the competition, since we opened up auditions to all artists and bands. In addition to a large scope of music, we want to involve the entire Coral Gables community by allowing ANY ARTIST OR BAND IN CORAL GABLES to audition.</p>

            <h4>Auditions</h4>
            <p>Bands will audition on <strong>October 29th from 5-7 PM</strong> in Broby Hall in the Frost School of Music Campus for a panel. You will prepare one song (3-6 min) to audition in front of a panel. Upon reviewing auditions, we will narrow it down to a few groups to perform at the live show. Following this audition, you will be contacted in the coming days about the results.</p>
            
            <h4>Performance</h4>
            <p>The selected finalists will perform at the UC Patio Lakeside Stage on <strong>Friday November 18th, 2016 at 7PM</strong>. When the finalists perform at the competition, the bands will be judged on music selection, audience energy, technical skills, and funds raised. Donation jars will be set up during performances, so people can support their favorite band by putting money in their jar. The judges will crown the champion while the fans will vote to decide the fan favorite. Both winners will receive prizes. Last year, the grand prize was a $300 Guitar Center Shopping spree.</p>
