			<h3>Community Service</h3>

			<p>Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia has a long history of active involvement with community service. The fraternity was founded with community involvement as a fundamental objective, the original chapter frequently visiting local hospitals to sing to patients and their families. This tradition is still an important part of Beta Tau’s philanthropy in the form of Mills Music Mission, named after our founder, Ossian E. Mills.</p>

			<p>Recently for Mills Music Mission, Beta Tau traveled to Miami’s Ronald McDonald House to sing and perform for the families of patients temporarily living in the House, and in addition has participated in several other service events, including Feeding South Florida, a food drive benefitting locals in need.</p>
